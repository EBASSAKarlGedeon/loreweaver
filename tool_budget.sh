# tool_budget.sh — per-task tool-call budget for Claude Code.
#
# Every tool call Claude makes is a fresh API request that re-sends the whole
# conversation, so capping tool calls caps token spend. Wired as BOTH hooks in
# .claude/settings.json (same command; the event is detected from the JSON
# read on stdin):
#
#   PreToolUse        -> counts the call; denies it (exit 2) once the budget
#                        for this task is spent. The denial message is fed
#                        back to Claude so it wraps up in text.
#   UserPromptSubmit  -> resets the counter (one user message = one task) —
#                        but ONLY for a genuine user prompt. Automated
#                        re-invocations (background-task completions and
#                        injected reminders) also arrive through this event
#                        and must NOT reset, or every background completion
#                        would hand out a fresh budget mid-task.
#
# Escape hatch: when over budget, only PLAIN git progress commands pass —
# `git add|commit|push|status|diff|log` as the whole command, with no pipes,
# chains or substitution characters (`|;&`$`) anywhere in the input.
# Everything else stays denied, so file reads cannot be smuggled in as
# `git diff | grep` or `git grep`.
#
# Change the budget by editing this one number (or export TOOL_BUDGET=NN):
MAX_TOOL_CALLS="${TOOL_BUDGET:-75}"
# Warning starts when 25% of the budget is left: floor(0.75 * MAX).
